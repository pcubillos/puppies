- mcmc


centering:
- run_centering
    driver: load files, launch runs (series)

Let's make puppies work.
puppies must work from the command line or from an interactive session:

## Interactive:
import puppies as p

# New puppy:
pup = p.init("cfile.cfg")

# New step:
pup.badpix()
pup.center()

# Load:
pup = p.io.load(path + "wa043b.p")

## Command line:
  TBD

On now puppy, take the location of the config file as the root where
to place the outputs.

Got a basic package import working, and interactive init() running.
Added required files.
Need to find a solution for all_spitzer.vec (file too large),
download during 'make'?
