Calling sequence:
  ./pup.py pup.cfg

This seems to be enough.  All required info can be contained into the
pup.cfg file, including what steps to run, and over which folders.

Main steps:
+ load
+ badpixel
- centering
- photometry
- modeling
- mcmc


centering:
- run_centering
    driver: load files, launch runs (series)
- centering
    main: 
- do_center
    low level centering
- centerdriver

TBD centering:
- read in data, mask, uncert


*****  Sat Aug 19 20:19:37 CEST 2017  *****

Let's make puppies work.
puppies must work from the command line or from an interactive session:

## Interactive:
import puppies as p

# New puppy:
pup = p.init("cfile.cfg")

# New step:
pup.badpix()
pup.center()

# Load:
pup = p.io.load(path + "wa043b.p")

## Command line:
  TBD

On now puppy, take the location of the config file as the root where
to place the outputs.

module.


*****  Sun Sep 24 18:51:34 CEST 2017  *****

Implemented gaussian functions into center module.
TBD: give them their own submodule inside the center module.


*****  Mon Sep 25 23:09:32 CEST 2017  *****

Implemented least-asymetry routines into center module.


*****  Tue Sep 26 21:01:11 CEST 2017  *****

Cleaned up the disk.py and cdisk.c functions.


*****  Sun Oct  1 15:04:01 CEST 2017  *****

Sorted up gaussian, made it its own module inside the center module.

*****

Implemented center-of-light calculation into center module.

*****

Implemented center driver.py routine.


*****  Sun Oct  8 22:55:49 CEST 2017  *****

Got pup_center running (yay!).
Added temporary calling sequence to pup_center.
Fixed minor bug in center/driver.py for least-asym calls.
Tweaked main driver (removed parse() def).
Put user-input dict (from config files) into pup.inputs.


*****  Sat Oct 21 18:56:15 CEST 2017  *****

Rewrote disk C extension, moving most of the work into the cdisk.h
header, such it can be called from other C extentions.


*****  Fr 27. Okt 17:23:32 CEST 2017  *****

Implemented and documented the low-level aperture photometry routine
in aphot.c (a C extension).

*****

Incorporated aperture photometry in the puppies.photometry submodule.


*****  Sun Oct 29 17:05:52 CET 2017  *****

Implemented aperture photometry module.
Optimal photometry is TBI.

*****

Renamed centering's expand input to psfscale (pixel scale ratio
between the PSF and data images) to avoid conflict with photometry's
expand interpolating factor.


*****  Sat Nov  4 11:59:41 CET 2017  *****

Added some extra information about the Spitzer bad-pixel-mask bits,
still not completely sure it's the right one.


*****  Sun Nov 12 20:47:00 CET 2017  *****

Revampled spitzer.py to handle time stamps with astropy.time objects
for the ephtime and fp.time values.  This simplifies the light
travel time corrections, bjd-utc corrections, phase calculation.
The pipeline now takes the spacecraft location from the headers
instead of the horizons file.
All of these calculation are now in Spitzer.py rather than after
the photometry step.

Also, revamped the main object's FrameParameter from 2D into 1D.
This commit breaks all further steps of the pipeline.


*****  Sat Nov 18 22:09:59 CET 2017  *****

Adapted pup_badpix.py to the new data shape.

*****

Adapted pup_centering.py to the new data shape.

Added MC3 submodule.

*****

Added background() and rawflux() to plots module.
Generate raw flux and background plots at the end of pup_photom.py.


*****  Sun Jan 28 17:56:23 CET 2018  *****

Added models module with lightcurve models.
Added linramp(), mandelecl(), and bliss() light-curve models.
TBD: Need to doublecheck bliss model works.


*****  So 18. Feb 18:21:45 CET 2018  *****

Implemented linramp, quadramp, expramp, mandelecl, mandeltr, and bliss
light-curve models.

light-curve model parameters, bounds, and stepsizes.

*****

Added pup_model.py which implements the Model() and Fit() clasess
(for light-curve modeling).  It also implements the puppies.setup()
method, which prepares the code for a light-curve fitting/posterior
sampling.

TBI in this file: the fit() and mcmc() methods, which do the
least-square optimization and posterior sampling of the light-curve
modeling.


*****  So 25. Feb 18:54:17 CET 2018  *****

Implemented pup_model.fit(). Need to tie some loose ends (write file,
output, pickle file).
Sorted out variables in pup_model.setup().
Cleaned up pup_model.evalmodel().
Enabled chiscale and optimizer arguments for light-curve modeling.

*****

Implemented sigrej at the begining of pup_model.setup().
Need to think what to do if the data veries significantly from stat to
end, messing up the sigma rejection (do piecewise?, what's a good
recipe for this).
Also could do a sigrej from the residuals, after an initial fit
(consider if fit fails, it may mess up things as well).


*****  Sun Apr  8 20:01:23 CEST 2018  *****

Implemented newparams() and saveparams() in puppies.tool submodule.
This let's the user create a new modelparams file with default values
and to update an existing file with values from a Fit() object,
respectively.

*****

Minor corrections in _quadramp.c, _mandeltr.c, and _mandelecl.c
light-curve models.

*****

Updated fit() in pup_model.py to return the Model() object and store
best-fitting values into modelparams file(s).
Added update argument in evalmdel to update the models' parameters.


*****  Di 17. Apr 16:27:31 CEST 2018  *****

Combined all ramp models into ramps.py, where the specific models
inherit from the Ramp() superclass.
Files need to be properly documented.

to obj in the settup() method.

*****

Added eclipse submodule, which implements mandelecl() and eclipse()
light-curve models.

*****

Adapted puppies.models' init to new ramps.py file and eclipse module.  
Removed mandelecl.py file (replaced with eclipse submodule).

*****

Updated Makefile to include submodules
and make it less verbose.

*****

Adapted pup_model.py to latest changes in puppies.models.


*****  Sun May 27 22:57:36 CEST 2018  *****

Renamed pup.model.fit() to lcfit() to avoid variable name conflict.
Added SDR and BIC calculations to laika object during lcfit().

to fit with lowest SDR.


*****  Mon Jun 11 01:06:49 CEST 2018  *****

Updated MC3 submodule.

*****

Renamed spitzer.py to pup_spitzer.py


*****  Sun Jun 17 12:48:05 CEST 2018  *****

Reorganized the project, adding the core and inst modules that
contain the main reduction steps and the dataset initialization
routines, respectively.

*****

Renamed uncd variable to uncert.

*****

Return to original location after running core.center() and
core.photom().


*****  Sun Oct 14 17:00:00 CEST 2018  *****

Use datafile variable for the filepath to data, rather than using the
data variable itself (same for uncert and bdmskd).
Revamped io.save() accordingly.
