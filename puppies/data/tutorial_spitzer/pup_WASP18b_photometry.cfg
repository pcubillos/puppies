[PUPPIES]

# Photometry method:
# Either a float setting the aperture radius (in pixels) or 'optimal':
photap = 3.5 3.75 4.0 4.25 4.5 4.75 5.0
# Inner/outer sky annulus (single value or one for each photap):
skyin  =  7.0
skyout = 14.0

# Number of parallel processors:
ncpu = 16
# Required fraction of good pixels in sky:
skyfrac = 0.1
# The sky estimation: True:median, False:mean.
skymed = True

# Interpolation rescaling factor for data and for the PSF:
expand = 5
psfexpand = 5

# Optimal photometry box-radius:
otrim = 8
